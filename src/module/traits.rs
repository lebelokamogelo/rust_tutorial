    A trait defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other types.
    We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way.
    We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.


    Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called interfaces in other languages, although with some differences.
