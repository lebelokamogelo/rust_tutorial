    // thread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a mutex,
    // a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the
    // mutexâ€™s lock. The lock is a data structure that is part of the mutex that keeps
    // track of who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the mutex
    // is described as guarding the data it holds via the locking system.
